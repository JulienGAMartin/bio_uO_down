Your acknowledgement should at a minimum specify which technology was used, include explicit description on how the information was generated, and explain how the output was used in your work. Below is a suggested format:\n\n\n“I acknowledge the use of [insert AI system(s) and link] to [specific use of generative artificial intelligence]. The output from these was used to [explain use].”\n\n\nFree text section for you to record your acknowledgment and gratitude for the more general academic input and support such as financial support from grants and scholarships and the non-academic support you have received during the course of your enrolment.\n\n\nYou may also wish to acknowledge significant and substantial contribution made by others to the research, work and writing represented and/or reported in the thesis. These could include significant contributions to: the conception and design of the project; non-routine technical work; analysis and interpretation of research data; drafting significant parts of the work or critically revising it so as to contribute to the interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllaire, J.

    "text": "2.1 Exponential smoothing\nExponential smoothing methods were originally developed in the late 1950s (Brown 1959, 1963; Holt 1957; Winters 1960). Because of their computational simplicity and interpretability, they became widely used in practice.\nEmpirical studies by Makridakis and Hibon (1979) and Makridakis et al. (1982) found little difference in forecast accuracy between exponential smoothing and ARIMA models. This made the family of exponential smoothing procedures an attractive proposition (see Chatfield et al. 2001).\nThe methods were less popular in academic circles until Ord et al. (1997) introduced a state space formulation of some of the methods, which was extended in Hyndman et al. (2002) to cover the full range of exponential smoothing methods.",
