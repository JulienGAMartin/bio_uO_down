    "text": "A thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biology at the University of Ottawa, Faculty of Science, Department of Biology.\nAbstract\nThe abstract should outline the main approach and findings of the thesis and must not be more than 500 words.\nSommaire\nThe abstract but in french this time.\nDeclaration\nReproducibility statement\nThis thesis was written using Quarto (Allaire et al. 2022) and the R Statistical Software v4.3.3, Angel Food Cake (R Core Team 2023), and the R packages listed in Table A.1. All materials (including the data sets and source files) required to reproduce this document can be found at the Github repository github.com/youraccount/thesis.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\nAuthor declaration\nI hereby declare that this thesis contains no material which has been accepted for the award of any other degree or diploma at any university or equivalent institution and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this thesis contains no material previously published or written by another person, except where due reference is made in the text of the thesis.\nThe ideas, development and writing up of all the papers in the thesis were the principal responsibility of myself, the student, working under the supervision of Julien Martin. The inclusion of co-authors reflects the fact that the work came from active collaboration between researchers and acknowledges input into team-based research. This thesis was written in manuscript style and I have renumbered sections of submitted or published papers in order to generate a consistent presentation within the thesis.\nCo-authorship statement\nThe following people and institutions contributed to the publications included in this thesis:\n\nBob Hette (BH): University of Ottawa, Canada\nIgor Tex (IT): University of Textile, Softland\nJulien Martin (JGAM): University of Ottawa, Canada\n\nMy first manuscript.\nIntegrated as Chapter 2 in this thesis. Under review at time of submission.\nAuthors:\n\nBH: Conceptualization, Investigation, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing -Original Draft.\nIT: Writing - Review & Editing.\nJGAM: Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Writing - Review & Editing.\n\nMy second manuscript.\nIntegrated as Chapter 3 in this thesis. Under review at time of submission.\nAuthors:\n\nBH: Conceptualization, Investigation, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing -Original Draft.\nIT: Writing - Review & Editing.\nJGAM: Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Writing - Review & Editing.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank my pet goldfish for …\n\nIf you have engaged the services of a professional editor, you must provide their name and a brief description of the service rendered. If the professional editor’s current or former area of academic specialisation is similar your own, this too should be stated as it may suggest to examiners that the editor’s advice to the student has extended beyond guidance on English expression to affect the substance and structure of the thesis.\n\n\nIf you have used generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, you must include a written acknowledgment of the use and its extent. Your acknowledgement should at a minimum specify which technology was used, include explicit description on how the information was generated, and explain how the output was used in your work. Below is a suggested format:\n\n\n“I acknowledge the use of [insert AI system(s) and link] to [specific use of generative artificial intelligence]. The output from these was used to [explain use].”\n\n\nFree text section for you to record your acknowledgment and gratitude for the more general academic input and support such as financial support from grants and scholarships and the non-academic support you have received during the course of your enrolment.\n\n\nYou may also wish to acknowledge significant and substantial contribution made by others to the research, work and writing represented and/or reported in the thesis. These could include significant contributions to: the conception and design of the project; non-routine technical work; analysis and interpretation of research data; drafting significant parts of the work or critically revising it so as to contribute to the interpretation.\n\nIndigenous affirmation\n\nNi manàdjiyànànig Màmìwininì Anishinàbeg, ogog kà nàgadawàbandadjig iyo akì eko weshkad.

We acknowledge their longstanding relationship with this territory, which remains unceded. We pay&gt; respect to all Indigenous people in this region, from all nations across Canada, who call Ottawa home. We acknowledge the traditional knowledge keepers, both young and old. And we honour their courageous leaders: past, present, and future.\n\nThis Indigenous Affirmation was written the Office of Indigenous Affairs at the University of Ottawa, in partnership with the Indigenous Education Council, Indigenous student groups, and members of the local Indigenous community (https://www.uottawa.ca/about- us/indigenous/indigenous-affirmation). This statement acknowledges that the University of Ottawa, including the Kerr lab where I completed work for this thesis, was built on the traditional territory of the Algonquin Nation. I collected all the data for this thesis within the boundary of the City of Ottawa, which includes the traditional territory of the Algonquin Nation and the Mohawk Nation (https://native-land.ca/). I acknowledge my own settler history, as well as the colonial history of the University of Ottawa. I will continue to educate myself on Canada’s colonial past and current Indigenous issues, and to leverage any power I have for (re)conciliation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllaire, J.

    "text": "1.1 Structure of a thesis\nYou start with the frontmatter, usually including abstract acknowledgements and declaration of co-authorship. Then, you have a general Introduction where you introduce the main ideas of your thesis, and an overview of the context and background. In a PhD, typically, Chapters 2–4 would contain your own contributions. Think of each of these as potential papers to be submitted to journals. Finally, Chapter 5 provides some concluding remarks, discussion, ideas for future research, and so on. Appendixes can contain additional material that don’t fit into any chapters, but that you want to put on record. For example, additional tables, output, etc.\nFor a MSc thesis with only 1 manuscript, then the thesis will be composed of the frontmatter followed by the manuscript where each section of the manuscript (e.g. introduction, methods, …) is a chapter, and finished by the bibliography and appendices.",

It must contain:\n\nIntroduction\nLiterature review\nInformation enabling a trained researcher reading the chapter to develop sufficient understanding of the field to understand the theme and questions/hypotheses of the dissertation\nDissertation theme and objectives or hypotheses to be tested\nManuscript Chapters\nEach subsequent chapter, aside from the General Conclusion, comprises a single manuscript (published, submitted, or nearly submitted). Importantly, however, a single, consistent format must be used, and chapters must be presented in a logical progression.\n\nYou may include an introductory “Context” section for each chapter, to establish the overall flow within the thesis and to build a tie to previous chapters. If you have not included a Declaration of co-authorship in the frontmatter, this section should include an authorship statement to explain your role in the research, as well as the roles of any co-authors on the corresponding publication. Normally, it is expected that a PhD student will be the first author on any papers arising from their research.\nSupporting information (SI) also refered to as Electronic Suplementary Material or Appendices, should be provided as Appendices to the thesis.\nIf the paper was a Communication or Report, you may have key details in the Supporting Information (SI). Any important elements in the SI, such as experimental details, should be integrated into the main body of the chapter. Less critical elements should be included at the end of the thesis as appendices.\nIn some cases, subsequent developments in the field may change the conclusions of one of your published chapters. This may be mentioned in a final “Subsequent Advances” section following the conclusion of the chapter. This should be discussed with your supervisor.\nNot every paper you’ve published has to be included. If your contribution to a paper was minor (and you are not the first author), omit it. Talk to your supervisor about what you will include.\nGeneral Conclusion\nThis is a significant part of a manuscript-based dissertation. It is NOT simply a summary of the manuscript chapters. It must include:\n\nA full analysis of the findings in the various chapters in light of current research in the field\nDiscussion of the overall significance and contribution of the research to the field of study\nDiscussion and conclusions relating the chapters to each other and the overall field\nComments on strengths and weaknesses of the dissertation research\nEvaluation of current knowledge and proposals for new ideas related to the field of study\nPresentation of the status of relevant working hypotheses\nDiscussion of any potential applications of the research findings",
