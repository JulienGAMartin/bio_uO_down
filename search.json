    "text": "A thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Ottawa, Faculty of Science, Department of Biology.\nAbstract\nThe abstract should outline the main approach and findings of the thesis and must not be more than 500 words.\nSommaire\nThe abstract but in french this time.\nDeclaration\nReproducibility statement\nThis thesis was written using Quarto (Allaire et al. 2022) and the R Statistical Software v4.3.2, Eye Holes (R Core Team 2023), and the R packages listed in Table A.1. All materials (including the data sets and source files) required to reproduce this document can be found at the Github repository github.com/youraccount/thesis.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\nAuthor declaration\nI hereby declare that this thesis contains no material which has been accepted for the award of any other degree or diploma at any university or equivalent institution and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this thesis contains no material previously published or written by another person, except where due reference is made in the text of the thesis.\nThe ideas, development and writing up of all the papers in the thesis were the principal responsibility of myself, the student, working under the supervision of Julien Martin. The inclusion of co-authors reflects the fact that the work came from active collaboration between researchers and acknowledges input into team-based research. This thesis was written in manuscript style and I have renumbered sections of submitted or published papers in order to generate a consistent presentation within the thesis.\nCo-authorship statement\nThe following people and institutions contributed to the publications included in this thesis:\n\nBob Hette (BH): University of Ottawa, Canada\nIgor Tex (IT): University of Textile, Softland\nJulien Martin (JGAM): University of Ottawa, Canada\n\nMy first manuscript.\nIntegrated as Chapter 2 in this thesis. Under review at time of submission.\nAuthors:\n\nBH: Conceptualization, Investigation, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing -Original Draft.\nIT: Writing - Review & Editing.\nJGAM: Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Writing - Review & Editing.\n\nMy second manuscript.\nIntegrated as Chapter 3 in this thesis. Under review at time of submission.\nAuthors:\n\nBH: Conceptualization, Investigation, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing -Original Draft.\nIT: Writing - Review & Editing.\nJGAM: Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Writing - Review & Editing.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank my pet goldfish for …\n\nIf you have engaged the services of a professional editor, you must provide their name and a brief description of the service rendered. If the professional editor’s current or former area of academic specialisation is similar your own, this too should be stated as it may suggest to examiners that the editor’s advice to the student has extended beyond guidance on English expression to affect the substance and structure of the thesis.\n\n\nIf you have used generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, you must include a written acknowledgment of the use and its extent. Your acknowledgement should at a minimum specify which technology was used, include explicit description on how the information was generated, and explain how the output was used in your work. Below is a suggested format:\n\n\n“I acknowledge the use of [insert AI system(s) and link] to [specific use of generative artificial intelligence]. The output from these was used to [explain use].”\n\n\nFree text section for you to record your acknowledgment and gratitude for the more general academic input and support such as financial support from grants and scholarships and the non-academic support you have received during the course of your enrolment.\n\n\nYou may also wish to acknowledge significant and substantial contribution made by others to the research, work and writing represented and/or reported in the thesis. These could include significant contributions to: the conception and design of the project; non-routine technical work; analysis and interpretation of research data; drafting significant parts of the work or critically revising it so as to contribute to the interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllaire, J.

The big advantage of using quarto is that it allows you to include your R or Python code directly into your thesis, to ensure there are no errors in copying and pasting, and that everything is reproducible. It also helps you stay better organized.\nFor details on using Quarto, see http://quarto.org.",

The data should be in exactly the format you obtained it. Do no editing or manipulation of the data prior to including it in the data directory. Any data munging should be scripted and form part of your thesis files (possibly hidden in the output).",
